To start, in the terminal, enter:
    [$django-admin.py startproject mysite]


This creates a directory that will have a few functions - manage the web server for development and 
direct the URL to the app.

To create the physical app, in the terminal, enter:
    $python manage.py startapp hello

This will create another director. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Files to change:

urls.py:

    from django.conf.urls.defaults import *
 
    from hello.views import hello

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
    ('^hello/$', hello)
 
    )

What this really means -> ('^hello/$', hello)

'^hello/$' - This will be apart of the url to access the app.
example - http://www.yoursite.com/hello

hello - This is the name of the method that will be called inside of view.py

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


hello/view.py:


    # Create your views here.
    #sends information back to Tropo
    from django.http import HttpResponse  
    #This will allow you to call Tropo functions
    from tropo import Tropo 
    #This will bypass authorization
    from django.views.decorators.csrf import csrf_exempt
    @csrf_exempt

 
    #hello was are method name called by urls.py 
    def hello(request): 
        t = Tropo()
        #This is the initial text that you want
        msg = request.POST['msg'] 
        #This sends a text reply back
        json = t.say("you just said: " + msg) 
        #This renders the reply into JSON so Tropo can read it
        json = t.RenderJson(json) 
        #This sends the JSON to Tropo
        return HttpResponse(json)

This is the app that gets runs. Notice that the method name is hello, the same as the method call in urls.py.

To start the development web-server, in the terminal (make sure that you are in the mysite directory), enter:
    $python manage.pt runserver
